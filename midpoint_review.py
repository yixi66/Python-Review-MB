# create 3 different variables with any whole number assined as the value and convert them into a string using the str() constructor.
# once you convert them print out the variables. Example: convert 3 to '3'
# if you use print(type(<var_name>)) this will print out the type of variable for example x = 3 would print 'int' and x = '3' would print 'str'

# Write a program that asks the user for the current temperature (F) and then use their Input calculate temperature in (C).

# Write a program that asks the user to input how much money they have saved up.

# Now take the code you wrote for problem 4a and put it in a function called calc_investment(). It should take two parameters:
# the users savings and the growth rate. So it would look something like def calc_investment(savings, growth_rate):
# Once you have the function created call this function in your main with different savings and growth rate. 
# If you are unsure how to 'call' a function. All you have to do is type it out in your main.
