# 1.
# Create Input Variables for your first name, last name and age.
# Then print out your full name and age within a sentence

first_name = input("What is your first name: ")
Last_name = input("What is your last name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")

print("My name is " ,first_name + Last_name, ", I am " ,age ," years old")




# 2. 
# create 3 different variables with any whole number assined as the value and convert them into a string using the str() constructor.
# once you convert them print out the variables. Example: convert 3 to '3'
# if you use print(type(<var_name>)) this will print out the type of variable for example x = 3 would print 'int' and x = '3' would print 'str'

number=[4, 25, 68]
# int
print(number)
# str
print(str(number))
